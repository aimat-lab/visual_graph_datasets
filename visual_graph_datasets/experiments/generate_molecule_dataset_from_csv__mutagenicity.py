"""
This experiment processes the "Mutagenicity" dataset, which consists of ~6k molecular graphs that are 
annotated with a binary classification label of either "mutagenic" or "non-mutagenic". These labels were 
determined by the publicly available test results of the Ames mutagenicity assay.

# == SOURCE PARAMETERS ==
# These parameters determine how to handle the source CSV file of the dataset. There exists the possibility
# to define a file from the local system or to download a file from the VGD remote file share location.
# In this section one also has to determine, for example, the type of the source dataset (regression, 
# classification) and provide the names of the relevant columns in the CSV file.

# :param FILE_SHARE_PROVIDER:
#       The vgd file share provider from which to download the CSV file to be used as the source for the VGD
#       conversion. 
FILE_SHARE_PROVIDER: str = 'main'
# :param CSV_FILE_NAME:
#       The name of the CSV file to be used as the source for the dataset conversion.
#       This may be one of the following two things:
#       1. A valid absolute file path on the local system pointing to a CSV file to be used as the source for
#       the VGD conversion
#       2. A valid relative path to a CSV file stashed on the given vgd file share provider which will be
#       downloaded first and then processed.
CSV_FILE_NAME: str = os.path.join(ASSETS_PATH, 'mutagenicity.csv')
# :param INDEX_COLUMN_NAME:
#       (Optional) this may define the string name of the CSV column which contains the integer index
#       associated with each dataset element. If this is not given, then integer indices will be randomly
#       generated for each element in the final VGD
INDEX_COLUMN_NAME: t.Optional[str] = None
# :param SMILES_COLUMN_NAME:
#       This has to be the string name of the CSV column which contains the SMILES string representation of
#       the molecule.
SMILES_COLUMN_NAME: str = 'smiles'
# :param TARGET_TYPE:
#       This has to be the string name of the type of dataset that the source file represents. The valid 
#       options here are "regression" and "classification"
TARGET_TYPE: str = 'classification'
# :param TARGET_COLUMN_NAMES:
#       This has to be a list of string column names within the source CSV file, where each name defines 
#       one column that contains a target value for each row. In the regression case, this may be multiple 
#       different regression targets for each element and in the classification case there has to be one 
#       column per class.

# These parameters control aspects of the visual graph dataset creation process. This for example includes 
# the dimensions of the graph visualization images to be created or the name of the visual graph dataset 
# that should be given to the dataset folder.

# :param DATASET_CHUNK_SIZE:
#       This number will determine the chunking of the dataset. Dataset chunking will split the dataset
#       elements into multiple sub folders within the main VGD folder. Especially for larger datasets
#       this should increase the efficiency of subsequent IO operations.
#       If this is None then no chunking will be applied at all and everything will be placed into the
#       top level folder.

#       This dict will be converted into the .meta.yml file which will be added to the final visual graph dataset

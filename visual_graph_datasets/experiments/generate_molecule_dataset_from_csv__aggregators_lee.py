# == SOURCE PARAMETERS ==
# These parameters determine how to handle the source CSV file of the dataset. There exists the possibility
# to define a file from the local system or to download a file from the VGD remote file share location.
# In this section one also has to determine, for example, the type of the source dataset (regression, 
# classification) and provide the names of the relevant columns in the CSV file.

#       The vgd file share provider from which to download the CSV file to be used as the source for the VGD
#       conversion. 
FILE_SHARE_PROVIDER: str = 'main'
# :param CSV_FILE_NAME:
#       The name of the CSV file to be used as the source for the dataset conversion.
#       This may be one of the following two things:
#       1. A valid absolute file path on the local system pointing to a CSV file to be used as the source for
#       the VGD conversion
#       2. A valid relative path to a CSV file stashed on the given vgd file share provider which will be
#       downloaded first and then processed.

#       (Optional) this may define the string name of the CSV column which contains the integer index

#       generated for each element in the final VGD
INDEX_COLUMN_NAME: t.Optional[str] = None

#       This number will determine the chunking of the dataset. Dataset chunking will split the dataset
#       elements into multiple sub folders within the main VGD folder. Especially for larger datasets
#       this should increase the efficiency of subsequent IO operations.

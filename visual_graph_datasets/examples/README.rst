This folder contains some example modules which each show a different aspect if the library

The following list provides a brief overview of the contents of the various examples. It is generally recommended 
to go through the examples in order, since the later examples build on facts that were established in the earlier ones.

- ``00_quickstart.py``: The quickstart example from the README file
- ``01_explanation_pdf``: Shows how an explanation PDF file can be created to visualize multiple explanations for 
  multiple elements of a visual graph dataset. Especially useful to visualize the bulk results of an attributional XAI method.

class MoleculeProcessing(ProcessingBase):
    """
    This class is used for the processing of the special "Molecule Graph" graph type. A molecule graph consists of 
    mutliple atoms (nodes) which are connected by different types of bonds (edges). The class provides methods to process 
    the domain string representation of molecule graphs (SMILES strings) into the graph dict representation. The class also 
    provides methods to create a new visual graph dataset element based on the given molecule graph.
    
    **Domain Representation**
    
    The domain specific representation of a molecule graph is called SMILES. It is a string representation of the
    molecular graph. SMILES is an established format for representing molecules and is used by many cheminformatics
    software packages. Characters in this string represent the different atom types while special characters such as 
    brackets and numbers represent the connections between the atoms. The SMILES string can be processed into a graph
    dict representation by using the ``process`` method.
    
    Examples:
    
    The string "C1=CC=C(N)C=C1" is a benzene ring to which a amine group is attached.
    
    **Graph Dict Representation**
    
    A domain-specific SMILES representation of a color graph can be processed into a graph dict representation 
    by using the ``process`` method. The graph dict representation is a dictionary which contains the full graph 
    data of the molecular graph.
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        smiles = "C1=CC=C(N)C=C1"
        processing = MoleculeProcessing()
        graph = processing.process(smiles)
        print(graph)
    
    **Visualization**
    
    A molecular graph can be visualized using the ``visualize`` method (numpy array) or alternatively the 
    ``visualize_as_figure`` method (matplotlib figure). The visualization will result in an image with the given 
    width and height in pixels.
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        smiles = "C1=CC=C(N)C=C1"
        processing = MoleculeProcessing()
        fig = processing.visualize_as_figure(smiles, width=1000, height=1000)
        plt.show()
        
    All the visualizations are created with the RDKit cheminformatics library - specificall the RDKit MolDraw2DSVG 
    functionality. The visualizations are created as SVG strings which are then converted into a numpy array or a
    matplotlib figure.
    
    **Customization**
    
    Generally, the most basic information that is encoded in a molecular graph is a one-hot encoding of the atom type 
    as part of the node attributes and an encoding of the bond type as part of the bond attributes. However, there are 
    many more possible bits of information that can be included for both the nodes and the edges. One might want to 
    customize the exact information that is encoded for a specific application. This can be easily done by subclassing
    the MoleculeProcessing class and overwriting the ``node_attribute_map`` and ``edge_attribute_map`` class variables.
    
    These class variables are dictionaries which map the names of the node and edge attributes to a dictionary which
    contains the callback function which is used to extract the attribute value from the molecule graph. The callback
    function is a function which takes the molecule graph and the atom or bond object as input and returns the value
    of the attribute. The callback function can be any function which returns a list of floats. The list of floats
    will be the attribute vector of the node or edge in the graph dict representation.
